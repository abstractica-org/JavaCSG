# ToDo

- **Implement Quarternions**  
  Quarternions would be a nice feature to have.


- **Create more common shapes**  
  What shapes are beeing used a lot and should be part of the library?


- **Create reader and writer for .3mf files**  
  This should actually be done in JavaOpenSCAD first.

- **Consider new base implementation**  
  Consider an implementation with a local mesh representation.
